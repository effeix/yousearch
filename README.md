Browser extension that adds a shortcut for YouTube search bar

There is not much to explain about this extension. It adds a shortcut on all YouTube pages that allow focusing on the search bar by using Alt+S. Why YouTube hasn't enabled this feature by default I don't know. You can change the shortcut (on Google Chrome) by going to Extensions > Manage Extensions > Extensions Menu (top left) > Keyboard shortcuts.
